*	Description:										*
*														*
*	This program demonstrates soft-body collision		*
*	detection and response.  The cloth is modeled as	*
*	a mass-spring-damper particle system, using 		*
*	a Symplectic Euler integration to compute			*
*	the position of each particle with respect to		*
*	simulation time and the sum of forces acting on it. *
*														*
*	Costraint relaxation is applied between pairs of	*
*	of connected particles to increase numerical		*
*	stability for relatively large spring stiffness		*
*	coefficients.										*
*														*
*	The combination of cheap forward integration		*
*	and constraint relaxation with few iterations per 	*
*	simulation timestep allows the simulation to 		*
*	achieve greater numerical stability and run-time 	*
*	efficiency than using either apporach in isolation.	*
